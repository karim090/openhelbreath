= Introduction =

As Game Server code is platform independent, I will describe here how to setup IDE (Eclipse) for Windows and Linux.

=== Eclipse under Windows ===

1. Download Eclipse for Windows
2. Setup g++, make, MinGW etc. This document will help you -> http://max.berger.name/howto/cdt/
3. Configure PATH.
4. Reboot

Try from terminal (open -> cmd.exe) if you can use compilers. If so, please skip to setting up Project workspace.

=== Eclipse under Linux ===

1. Download package for your distribution.

Thats it.

= Setting up Project workspace =

1. Download latest source code.
2. From Eclipse: New -> C++ Project -> Empty project. Under Windows you should see (and use) MinGW toolchain. 
3. Set project name to GameServer
4. Set location to /path/svn/GameServer. You must have existing code in this folder.
5. Finish

Eclipse is smart enough to set up everything for us. Also, it should build it automagically.

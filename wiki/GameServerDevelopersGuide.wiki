= Introduction =

As Game Server code is platform independent, I will describe here how to setup IDE (Eclipse) for Windows and Linux.

=== Eclipse under Windows ===

 # Download Eclipse for Windows
 # Setup g++, make, MinGW etc. This document will help you -> http://max.berger.name/howto/cdt/
 # Configure PATH.
 # Reboot

Try from terminal (open -> cmd.exe) if you can use compilers. If so, please skip to setting up Project workspace.

=== Eclipse under Linux ===

 # Download package for your distribution.

Thats it.

= Setting up Project workspace =

 # Download latest source code.
 # From Eclipse: New -> C++ Project -> Empty project. Under Windows you should see (and use) MinGW toolchain. 
 # Set project name to GameServer
 # Set location to /path/svn/GameServer. You must have existing code in this folder.
 # Finish

Eclipse is smart enough to set up everything for us. Also, it should build it automagically.
